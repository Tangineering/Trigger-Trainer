# WORK_QUEUE.md — outstanding work

The central planning document for this project. An **orchestration session**
schedules work rounds from it; **exploratory sessions** add to it; **execution
agents** receive one item at a time, with the item's text as their brief.
Finished items leave this file and land in `WORK_COMPLETED.md` — this file
holds **only outstanding work**.

How to use it:

- Adding or editing an item → `.claude/skills/work-queue-add/SKILL.md`.
- Pulling a round, handing off, archiving → `.claude/skills/work-queue-run/SKILL.md`.
- The queue's canonical home is the default branch (`main`); a session that finds it
  only on a side branch merges that branch first.
- IDs are `WQ-NNN`, assigned from `next_id` below, never reused. An item keeps
  its ID for life (queue → completed).
- Order within the index is priority, then dependency order. It is not a
  promise of execution order — the orchestration session picks rounds.
- Project rules that every item inherits: `CLAUDE.md` (hard constraints, architecture, working
  rules). In particular: `npm test` after every engine or input-wiring change; bump `engine.js`
  `VERSION` when outputs change for the same inputs; real-phone checks are owner-verifiable
  acceptance lines; decisions an agent makes are logged as `Claude (proposed)` in
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Status values: `queued` · `claimed:<session or round>` · `blocked:<what>` ·
`blocked:user` (needs a decision only the owner can make — the item says which)
· `blocked:owner-machine` (needs data, hardware or a platform only the owner
has — the item says exactly what to run).

Mechanical edits (claim, un-claim, archive, invariant check) go through
`python scripts/wq.py …`; see `work-queue-run`. On Ricky's PC the interpreter is
`C:\Users\ricky\.local\bin\python.exe` (the `python` alias on PATH is the Microsoft Store stub).

## Items

### WQ-006 — Record axis and clean-press drills on an iPhone and a second Android phone

- **Status:** blocked:owner-machine · **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Track:** recordings · **Env:** owner-machine
- **Added:** 2026-10-20 by recordings-review session · **Updated:** 2026-10-21 by iPhone-15 analysis session (iPhone half done; second Android phone and the iPhone 3-minute drift run remain, D-61); 2026-10-21 by orchestration session (Ricky: the second Android phone waits for later; the iPhone 3-minute drift run also waits for later (Ricky, 2026-10-21); nothing is expected from the owner until Ricky says so); 2026-10-21 by orchestration session (round-20261021-2 closed: the owner-verifiable checks of WQ-001, WQ-002, WQ-009, WQ-011, WQ-012, WQ-013, WQ-014, WQ-015 and WQ-016 are collected below, so phone work lives in one item)
- **Depends on:** — · **Blocks:** —

**Progress.** The iPhone half is done. `tests/recordings/iphone-15/` holds all twelve drills (axis, clean-press, the
drift `free` run, and the rest), and the analysis half ran for that phone: Q1 closed (axis verdict `ios`, D-58), Q11
and the contact-size fact are in `CLAUDE.md` "Known platform facts", and the drift drill reads 8.5–9.3° at its rests
(Q10; under D-49's 10° limit, but a 93 s run with no jig confirmation). Two findings went to `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`
rather than this item: its `clean-press` failed on its first shot (Moved at 0.96°; Q14, settled by trimming that press
out of the file, D-59) and iOS flips to portrait and disarms during hard swings (Q15, I-04). Remaining: the second (non-Pixel) Android phone, plus the
full 3-minute jig drift run on the iPhone 15 (D-61: the 93 s run was on a jig and read 9°, so the long run
decides whether I-02 opens for that phone).

**Pending owner checks from rounds 1 and 2** (code landed and passed `npm test`; each line is the
owner-verifiable half of an archived item, see `WORK_COMPLETED.md`; tick them off on the phone, any session then
notes the result here and in the item's entry):
- Pixel 11, Settings: the "Flat-finger check" section is gone (WQ-009); with Gyro axis mapping on Auto, muzzle up
  moves the trace up and a swing right moves it right (WQ-001).
- Pixel 11: Start goes fullscreen and locks landscape, the start screen shows the Android note, a new recording
  carries `device.ios: false` (WQ-002). iPhone: the motion permission prompt still appears, the iPhone note shows.
- Pixel 11 with its old saved settings: after loading the updated page once, Settings shows `jerkMs` at 300 while
  deliberately moved sliders keep their values; after "Restore defaults" a reload keeps every slider at the code
  default (WQ-015).
- Pixel 11 and iPhone 15, finger off the frame: a slow sweep of about 10° alarms within a second of passing 5°;
  holding still off the frame does not alarm; twisting about the barrel axis alone does not alarm; decide whether a
  jerk past 5° during a press should alarm as it does now (WQ-011, D-67).
- iPhone 15 then Pixel 11, finger on the frame: swing through vertical so the phone flips to portrait for a moment:
  no disarm, no overlay, no repeated OK tone, and `180-break` still alarms past 90°; hold portrait for 4 s: the
  overlay appears and the trainer disarms (WQ-013). Re-record `180-break` and `free` on the iPhone and check the
  files carry no `p` rows at the flips.
- iPhone 15: the 3-minute jig drift drill with engine 0.11.0 or later; every rest under 5° (WQ-014, D-62).
- Pixel 11, sensor readout on: after a few seconds of handling the debug line reads `axis est xyz ×n` with n
  above 1.5 (WQ-012, D-57).
- iPhone 15 and Pixel 11, both hands: the taller frame strip, the forward trigger and the new guard feel natural to
  hold, and a 60 px pull breaks the shot without the finger running off the trigger (WQ-016, D-71, D-75).

**Context.** Everything measured so far comes from one Pixel 11. Three open points need a second
phone each: the iPhone gyro axis order (Q1), whether the iOS misdetection also affects other
Android phones (Q11), and whether the missing touch contact size (`CLAUDE.md`, "Contact size") is
Pixel-specific. Three short drills per phone answer all three.

**Scope.** On each additional phone (an iPhone; any non-Pixel Android), from the deployed HTTPS page:
- Record `axis-up`, `axis-right` and `clean-press` as described in `docs/RECORDINGS.md`, with the phone
  model in the notes field.
- Also record the jig drift drill (D-49): a `free` drill, phone placed on a fixed jig at the start, tap
  **Set downrange**, swing hard for about 90 s, return to the jig and hold still 10 s, swing again, and
  end on the jig held still for 10 s. The analysis reads the 180 deviation at the rests (under 10° in
  3 minutes closes the question for that phone; more re-opens `docs/IDEAS.md` I-02).
- Save them into a new folder named after the phone (for example `tests/recordings/iphone-15/`,
  `tests/recordings/galaxy-s24/`) and commit.
- Then (agent-verifiable half, any session): run `npm run test:replay`; record the per-phone axis
  verdict in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` Q1; record `device.ios` versus user agent (Q11) and whether any
  touch row has a non-zero radius (contact size) in `CLAUDE.md` "Known platform facts". If an iPhone
  verdict is `spec`, raise a new item to key the `auto` default on the browser engine.
- Out of scope: changing the engine or the page.

**Acceptance.**
- Owner-verifiable: the three drill recordings and the drift recording per phone exist under a per-phone folder.
- Agent-verifiable: `npm run test:replay` passes (or WQ-003's guard fails and a follow-up item is
  raised); Q1, Q11 and the contact-size note are updated with the measured facts.

**Verification.** The "Axis verdict" lines for each phone quoted in the completion entry.

## Parking lot

Ideas noted but not yet turned into items (an exploratory session may
promote one with `work-queue-add`):

- **Auto-switch of the axis mapping with a confidence gate** (proposal 3.6 steps 2–3). The advisory
  readout is WQ-012 (D-57); the switch waits for a second phone's recordings (WQ-006) and a Ricky decision.
- **Synthetic recordings that can identify an axis mapping** (from WQ-004). `tests/make-synthetic.js` emits
  no `accelerationIncludingGravity` and only `180-safe` rotates about all three axes, so the harness has to
  simulate gravity and 10 of 11 synthetic drills tie. Emit gravity and add one three-axis drill; then drop the
  simulation from `tests/axis-estimate.js`.
- **Q2, default thresholds for beginners.** Needs labelled drills from several students; first data
  points: one `clean-press` shot at 0.70° against the 0.75° Clean limit (Pixel 11, 2026-10-20) and the first iPhone 15
  `clean-press` shot at 0.96° (trimmed out of the recording, D-59; the figure is from the untrimmed file).
- **Q3 / Q4, zone layout and stray palm contact.** Needs class observation with the debug readout on;
  fallback is `docs/IDEAS.md` I-01 (per-student layout calibration).
- **Re-record the three `safe-move` drills with the current engine.** The 0.6.0 recordings still pass
  with current defaults; only worth doing so every real recording has a live-equals-replay check.
- **Operating modes on the start screen** (`docs/IDEAS.md` I-03, Ricky). Waiting for Ricky to list the modes.
- **`CLAUDE.md` says recordings go "one folder per phone"** — the 2026-10-20 set has been moved to
  `pixel-11/`; nothing left to do unless a second Pixel appears.
